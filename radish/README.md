radish uses RAD-ish algorithms to determine molecular topologies.

Note: radish is now developed to be Python3 compatible but has not been
properly tested for back-compatibility with Python2 yet. Please report possible
bugs.

Install with pip:

pip install .

Editable install (development):

pip install -e .

Then you can use

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

to rebuild the cython modules
